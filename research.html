				<b>
                <p><b>The overarching theme of my research is the relationship between biomaterials, fibrosis, and the immune system in normal and diseased states. My research interest is the design and development of immunomodulatory synthetic materials (grad and postdoc work) and the development of in vitro platforms for human diseases that cannot be replicated in animal models (grad work). The overall goal is to target fibrosis using the endogenous immune system to promote more effective tissue remodeling during injury (e.g. trauma to lung, muscle) or material integration (e.g. pelvic mesh) to improve patient outcome. To do this we will study how material design and function must be altered as the immune system changes with age and sex. Additionally, as many human fibrotic diseases, particularly Uterine Fibroids, cannot be replicated well in murine in vivo models, I see the need to leverage biomaterial design to develop in vitro organoid/organs-on-a-chip before we can engineer material systems to target fibrosis for this understudied disease.</b> </p>

											<p><b>A hallmark of aging is the immunological changes that increase susceptibility of the population to inflammatory age-related diseases. <br><br>Synthetic materials induce a proinflammatory immune response, with the proportion of people over 60 years old doubling from 12% to 22% by 2050. <br><br>There is a critical need to better understand how biologic factors such as age and sex contribute to the FBR.

											<br><br>T cells are implicated in the FBR and fibrosis. This work is elucidating the mechanism and contributions of T cells in the FBR.

											<p><b>Fibroids are a disease of age and race. They are the most common benign tumor of the uterus characterized by dense fibrosis and leading to heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pain, and infertility. By 50 nearly 2/3 of women will develop fibroids and Black women are diagnosed at 3x the rate as white women. 
												<br><br>Using computational and biologic approaches we are studying the senescence-immune interactions contributing to the abnormal extracellular matrix and vascularity within fibroids.

								<p>Delivering therapeutics locally to a specific sites or cells of interest is necessary to minimize off-target effects and therapeutic toxicity. 
									All variables of biomaterial design (size, shape, stiffness, porosity, adhesion molecules) will affect cell function and tissue morphology. 
									<br><br>I tested protease-degradable nanoparticle-inside-microgel design for delivery of therapeutics to the deep lung (Mej&iacute;as 2019 JCR) and delivered multi-stage particle delivery of a small molecule immunomodulator to modulate the neutrophil response to acute lung injury in mice (Mej&iacute;as 2019 JCI Insight).

								<p>Organs are complex structures with intricate cell-cell self-assembly to perform specialized functions. Often On-chip models of human physiology and disease allow us to study a simplified microenvironment to understand fundamental cell-cell communication and cell-biomaterial interactions. 
								<br>
									<br>My work primarily focused on the development of a microphysiologic device of the lung interstitium-airway interface to test multiple disease models including: idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, cystic fibrosis, lung cancer (Mej&iacute;as 2020 Lab Chip). I worked with peers to develop a human bone-marrow-on-a-chip (Nelson 2021 Biomaterials) and B cell lymphoma (Mannino 2017 Lab Chip)
